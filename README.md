# picolabs-lutron
This repository has 3 parts:
  1. The KRL code for the Lutron picos
  2. The telnet module for the pico-engine to be able to communicate over telnet
  3. The react code for the user application on Manifold

This repository is not designed to run on it's own. Rather it is a place to save changes for the different areas of this project
